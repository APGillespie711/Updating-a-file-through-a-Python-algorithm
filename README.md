## Updating-a-file-through-a-Python-algorithm

A sample demonstrative project in which python was used to achieve a task - in this case I chose to update a file through automation and algorithms within Python. 

All of which can be seen in the file which is a plain word document, but flows step by step through the building of the function in question. The code used is demonstrated in there too.
